                    <h2>My Classmates in Senior High School</h2>
                    <p>A journey that took 12 years, a journey that had so many obstacles, a journey that made me say goodbye to old friends and say hello to the new and unknown ones, a journey that had many tears and frustrations that made me almost give up, in this journey I have been with many classmates all them being unique on their own but this is one batch of my classmate that I enjoyed my time particularly with in this 12 years journey, this batch of classmates of mine are all chaos incarnate I once thought one my classmates as very quite and introverted until I found his real personality who is very loud and loves having fun, they are fun to be with even though sometimes they can be a headache, sometimes they are all noisy and sometimes they are obedient who follow our teachers words, all of them are full surprises that I can’t get enough of, I could even call all of them as my friends. I appreciate my time with this batch because of them they allowed me to crawl out of my shell that I have been protecting myself with from this cruel and unforgiving world and they are also responsible for allowing me to see my potential, I truly appreciate and hold dear to my heart the time that I shared with them.</p>

                    <h2>Successful Research Paper</h2>
                    <p>As the time of my Senior High School is getting closer to the end, our final project which is a research paper. Every single one of my classmates work was overseen by 4 panelist, and the panelist pointed all of the big mistakes in their research paper, and as time goes by and one by one each of my classmates research paper being analyzed, mistakes being pointed out, until it was my groups turn, my heart was pumping hard, my eyes getting dizzy due to the nervousness I felt in the situation so I steeled myself said to my mind that I can do this, as me and my group mates come to the center we presented our research paper to the panelist some of them read our research paper as we ended our presentation all of the panelist read our research paper with great focus, and I don’t know how much time passed until they finished reading the research paper but I can say it is very overwhelming as the thoughts of failure completely fills my mind it was only over until all of the panelist asked us questions on the research paper as time goes by all of the panelists complimented our research paper saying that no are major mistakes that ruins the research and they that our research was a successful, as I stepped outside of the room holding my research called “The effect of weekly reading sessions on Del Sur Good Shepherd Inc Senior High School Students English Reading Comprehension”  I screamed joy jumping like a kid who received his favorite in his birthday. </p>

                    <h2>My First proper Website</h2>
                    <p>As my first day as a BSIT student in BukSU I wondered if I can handle this, and as time flies by months have already gone by since my first day and we given a major output which to create a portfolio webpage. After this announcement I was scared because I don’t have that much experience in creating a website so I just steeled myself and said to myself “I can do this”, finally after weeks of working on the webpage I was able to finally finish it though it may not look good unlike other website but I am proud of it, and my journey as a BSIT student that I once thought to be very bleak is now shining like the sun.</p>

                    <p>Finally after 12 years of hard work it has finally paid off, after so many years of tears in those 12 years as I stand in my Graduation attire I looked back at the past and I am truly glad for those people that I have meet in those years they have brought me smiles and hope in my lowest times, now I am here standing in my Graduation attire with my beloved parents, when the speaker spoke my name my heart had a great leap my face reddened from cheer and congratulations from my classmates and family, after all of the events in the Graduation I grabbed my parents hands and asked my sister to take a picture of me and parents. It isn’t just an achievement it is an end of an era and a start of another.</p>

                    <h2>A New Beginning</h2>
                    <p>Bukidnon State University is the university that I choose to start a new, experience new things, and learn new things. This is a very big achievement for me as it signifies that I have obtained a milestone in my life, milestone that would determine my very future. A new beginning means more struggles and challenges that I will face but it is same for life as we live until to our death we will always face challenges and we must not falter and give up we must face it that way we will succeed and overcome those challenges, this new beginning will test me in every aspect from physical, mental, and spiritual, and I will prevail with an optimistic mind always hoping for a better future and never having negative thoughts.</p>
